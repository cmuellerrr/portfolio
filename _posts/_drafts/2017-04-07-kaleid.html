    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The general concept is that someone uses their body to create a unique mandala based on their movements.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>The mandala is basically made up of a bunch of individual pieces that create a segment. The segments are then mirrored and rotated in a circular pattern to form the repeating shape of a mandala.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/"\>
        <p class="caption">Image of piece -> segment -> mandala.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Kaleidoscopes are interesting because they change in front of your eyes. In order to do that programatically, the design within each segment can be controlled by altering variables. Say, one for color, one for shape, one for number of shapes, etc.</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/"\>
        <p class="caption">gif of updating a variable -> piece -> segment -> mandala.</p>
    </div>

    <p>So from there, i just had to map what variables to control and their bounds. The more complex variables involved mapping out the overal taxonomy of designs and how they transition between one another.</p>

    <h2>Human Motion</h2>
    <p>That's all well and good, but it's more interesting to map each of those variables to the movement of a human being. So now, we can map the movement of a person's arm to, say, the color of the first orbit piece.</p>

    <p>So the project will use a big screen in a public place to make people look stupid. It'll take a picture after a certain amount of time and print it out.</p>
