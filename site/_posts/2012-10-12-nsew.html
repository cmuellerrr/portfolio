		<p>NSEW is a concept eMagazine combining modern, outdoor lifestyle with reader-submitted personal narratives. The concept was inspired by a work titled “Bird Enemies”, written by John Burroughs in 1883.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Direction</h3>
		<p>We knew from the beginning that we wanted to focus on minimal styling and liked the idea of juxtaposing that design principle with the subject of nature and wildlife. The text also brought about the theme of personal narratives – using first hand encounters could provide a more impactful storytelling experience.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Research</h3>
		<p>We developed a mood board to get a better sense of our design language and began our research through competitive analysis. When doing so, we not only focused on target users and subject matter, but rated each competitor in regards to 5 main characterizations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Minimal – The magazine uses a simple and clean visual style</li>
			<li>Tranquil – The magazine conveys a sense of calm and peacefulness</li>
			<li>Narrative – The magazine uses personal narrative to present information to the reader</li>
			<li>Visual – The magazine uses photographs and other visual elements to dictate the reading experience</li>
			<li>Local – The magazine features articles that are local to the reader’s location</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="title">Implementation</h3>
		<p>Each article is presented as a single document which allows for continuous scrolling to the right. In these articles, we create a fluid layout to draw a reader’s eye forward while remaining uncluttered and coherent by allowing some elements to span gutters and also manipulating images to break out of their traditional frames.</p>

		<p>The design utilizes a subtle cartography theme throughout the magazine which was inspired by the outdoor subject matter; the title, NSEW, represents the cardinal directions and lines of latitude are used to represent article numbers within each issue.</p>
