		<p>As part of a group capstone project, I created a location-aware, social networking application.  The game was based off of the concept of Foursquare, but we modified the logic to use teams as the driving force behind its usage.  Users would join together to claim actual territory in the name of their team.  </p>

		<h3 class="title">Design</h3>
		<p>The thought was that, as an individual, there wasn’t much motivation to check in to locations.  Yes, you can show everyone where you are, but that inherently isn’t very meaningful to anyone.  However, if you turn that check-in into something meaningful, then there is greater motivation to continue using the product.  Therefore, we decided to group users into teams.

		The point of the application was pretty simple – based on a user’s current location, provide a list of possible locations that were within a set radius.  A user could then choose their current location and check-in as a member of a team.  Every check-in to a location would garner points for that team; the team with the most points at a location claimed that place as their own.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Implementation</h3>
		<p>We wanted to be able to show a team’s controlled territory in an interesting way.  I ended up implementing a K-means clustering algorithm to group controlled territory into clusters and then used the Graham scan method for determining the convex hull of each cluster.  Those convex hulls were then drawn as overlays on a map using the team’s chosen color.

		The application was built as both a web application (including a mobile optimized version) and an iPhone application.</p>
