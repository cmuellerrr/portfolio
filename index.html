                <p>As you may expect, NASA engineering data gets reviewed...a lot, requiring the owner to merge and address comments from tons of documents.</p>
                <p>We sought to improve this process by centralizing the data being reviewed and designing tools allowing review discussions to take place alongside the data itself.</p>

                <p>Working with the Arc Jet team, we created a responsive web application to improve their test setup process by reducing errors and increasing worksheet completion.</p>
