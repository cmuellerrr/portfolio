    <h2>Vitascope Arts</h2>
    <p>I did the branding and website for a video production company called Vitascope Arts. They make commercials for businesses and crowdfunding campaigns. I'm a big fan of branding and it was fun to get into it myself. I may write up a case study soon.</p>

    <h2>Better than Freddy?</h2>
    <p>Better than Freddy is the result of a conversation with my friend Jeff about whether or not a movie is "watchable". You enter the title of a movie and it tells you if it is better or worse than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240515/">Freddy Got Fingered</a>.</p>

    <h2>Transcription Sucks</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you need to transcribe interviews with users. Sometimes a lot of them. Having to do this <em>sucks</em>. I couldn't find any simple tools that combined audio manipulation and text entry, so I built my own. This was a life saver during grad school and a hit with classmates.</p>

    <p>The Robowall is an interactive display on Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s campus that highlights people, projects, research, and events within the Human-Computer Interaction Institute and the Robotics Institute. I was brought on to implement the design in openFrameworks. We then pivoted and remade it in JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Human Motion Analysis</h2>

    <p>We used CMU's motion capture lab to capture test subjects performing a number of different actions (running, throwing, etc.). We then analyzed that data to try to quantify the difference in how someone throws with their dominant hand as opposed to their non-dominant hand.</p>
