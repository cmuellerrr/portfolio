		<h3 class="title">Background</h3>
		<p>Currently, scientists on the ISS are forced to follow rigid, complex procedures throughout their day. These procedures, and the way they are useed, cause a significant reduction in efficiency; procedures are static word documents and are only viewable on wall-mounted laptops throughout the station.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Concept</h3>
		<p>After months of research, we developed a prototype procedure viewer utilizing a head-mounted display to allow for hands-free interaction.  The prototype also leverages augmented-reality to provide information in place within a crew's work environment.  For more details on the prototype and process, see our <a href=​"http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/M-HCI/2013/novo/" target=​"_blank">​project website​</a>.</p>
