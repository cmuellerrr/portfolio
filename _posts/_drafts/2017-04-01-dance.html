    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>The app has four main tabs: learn, moves, store, and profile.</p>

    <p>The learn tab is where you go to learn new moves. Every move is based off of a stance.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Users proceed through the learn tab in stages. Each stage has you learn a few moves across a particular stance, followed by a chance to check your skills.</p>

    <p>If you want to browse through the moves you already know, you can use the moves tab.</p>

    <p>The store and profile tabs are pretty straightforward. You can buy access to new stances and movesets, as well as powerups to increase various stats.</p>
