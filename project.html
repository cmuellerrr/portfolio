                    <p>I like peanut butter &#8211; and I buy my peanut butter from Costco &#8211; and those jars are huge.  They are larger than the knife I use to get the peanut butter out of the jar.  So, when the contents of the jar goes below 50% you end up getting your hand covered in peanut butter.  Also, the jars have sharp contours at the top which are inaccessible to your knife.  In order to continue buying unnecessarily large jars of peanut butter, I set out to make the jar better.</p>
                    <p>The first thing I sought to do was to reduce the amount of plastic used for the bottles by making the lid thinner.  This would to two things: reduce waste and compensate for the added plastic of the modular design.  I then decided to make the edges completely smooth so that all peanut butter would be in reach while also giving the entire jar a sleeker look and feel.  Finally after many iterations of jar design, I decided that the best option would be to utilize a sectional structure in order to remove the unneeded portions of the jar when empty.</p>
                    <p>In terms of the poster, I decided to go with a constructivist, propaganda design.  I figured that I needed powerful imagery in order to give this important subject matter the attention it deserves.  Plus, I figured it would be fun to try designing something with such a distinct style.  In order to get this effect, I utilized the rising fists, deep red lettering, and strong language to describe the product.  Also, I chose a color pallet that emphasized the golden, peanut buttery goodness that inspired the product redesign itself.  Overall, I think it worked out pretty well.</p>
