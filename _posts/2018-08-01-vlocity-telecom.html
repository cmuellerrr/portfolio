            <p>Vlocity wanted to show Dreamforce attendees that their platform could go beyond the boring, enterprise apps we're all used to. We worked with them to create a sleek, modern mobile app with plenty of 'wow' factor.</p>

            <p>Vlocity is one of Salesforce's fastest growing partners, providing software improvements for variety of industries like healthcare and finance. One of their offerings is a mobile app that companies use as a starting point from which to build their own, branded app.</p>

            <p>With Dreamforce coming up, Vlocity wanted to refresh the app's design to add some 'wow' factor and asked us to take a crack at it. Naturally, we jumped at the opportunity to design what would end up as a showpiece for their booth at Dreamforce 2018.</p>

        <h2>A fluid interface</h2>
        <p>Vlocity really wanted a design that was unique and eye catching, so we knew that a standard layout wasn't going to cut it. We focused the whole experience around a fluid, scrolling pattern to navigate from a plan overview to detailed device statistics. This gave us a great signature interaction that felt really natural in your hand.</p>

        <h2>Assistance</h2>
        <p>Smart assistants have been all the rage recently, but they often feel shallow and tacked on. We tried to make this feature more useful by providing contextual suggestions throughout the experience. When 'chatting' with the assistant, our goal was for the user to never use the keyboard by always surfacing the most likely actions and responses.</p>

        <h2>One stop shop</h2>
        <p>E-commerce is a big part of the telecom industry and we wanted that portion of the app to exhibit the same fluidity as the main page. By animating common elements from page to page, the store felt like one seamless experience as opposed to a set of distinct screens.</p>

            <p>This work was presented at Dreamforce 2018 to very positive results, leading to new business for our client and more work for us.</p>

            <p>Our relationship with Vlocity has been going for many years, and we always look forward to Dreamforce so we can really push their product beyond what is expected.</p>
