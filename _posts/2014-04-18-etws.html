    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/thermophysics-facilities/arcjet-complex">NASA Ames Arc Jet Complex</a> tests vehicle heat shielding by simulating flight- and re-entry conditions (i.e. lights stuff on fire). They configure the equipment &mdash; and verify that configuration &mdash; for each test based on steps described in a <em>task worksheet</em>. Their old, paper-based process needed some improvements, so we created an adaptive web application for authoring worksheets on desktop computers, and executing them on mobile devices.</p>

    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>The Arc Jet is an extremely complicated piece of equipment that can simulate flight- and re-entry conditions in a variety of different atmospheres. In order to configure this equipment properly for each test, engineers create <em>task worksheets</em> describing the equipment and configuration. The steps on this worksheet are executed by the facility technicians and may have follow-up quality assurance actions; some steps require additional data entry, and every step must be signed by the individuals responsible for it.</p>

    </div>

    <p>These worksheets were paper-based, which had the trade-offs you'd expect &mdash; it's portable and you can write on it, but it gets cluttered with revision markings, requires physical storage, it's not search-able, etc.</p>

    <p><b>We were asked to look in to a way to make this paper-based approach more efficient by reducing errors and increasing worksheet completion.</b></p>

    <h2>Our process</h2>
    <p>Like most projects, we started with contextual inquiries of those who interact with the <em>task worksheets</em> to produce flow and sequence models and identify breakdowns. We performed an artifact analysis of hundreds of existing worksheets to lay out the information being captured (both planned and unplanned). We also did quick competitive analysis of applications that structure discrete tasks and met with another organization at Ames that encountered a similar type of problem.</p>

        <p class="caption">We modeled the worksheet structure using — more or less — a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">CFG</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>After a few rounds of sketching and discussion, we started to hone in on an idea that could give users the authoring flexibility of a word processor, yet the structure needed for things like searching, linking, and sign-off. In order to refine this idea, I created a quick JavaScript prototype which ended up being instrumental in getting buy-in and conveying the concept to the rest of the team.</p>

    <h2>Our solution</h2>
    <p>Our research identified that there are effectively two phases of the worksheet life-cycle: authoring and execution. We saw that the worksheet authors did all of their work at their desktop computers, while executors were constantly on the move. The system is designed to take advantage of the user's situation in each of these phases.</p>

    <p>In the authoring phase, the system is designed for the engineers who will be creating documents on a standard, desktop web browser. The artifact analysis identified that a worksheet is made up of a standard set of components that can be tailored according to the specific test's needs. Our solution treats these components as building blocks that authors add and configure in whatever order needed.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In the execution phase, the system is designed for the technicians and QA representatives who will be on the move. Once an engineer is finished authoring the document, the worksheet becomes available on a mobile device so executors can perform their work while moving around the complex. As they work, they can enter values and sign off on steps they've completed.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    <p>During the design process, we had continual check-ins our stakeholders to make sure they were satisfied with the direction. Additionally, we set up usability tests with 6 eventual users to validate and tweak the design.</p>

    <p>Since the initial release in April 2014, we've had two major updates. Each release focused on adding a new capability to the system while making incremental improvements to existing features. They both used the standard methods of contextual inquiry, retrospective interviews, and usability testing.</p>
