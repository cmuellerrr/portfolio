    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I created a concept for a mobile application that teaches people stupid dance moves. So instead of teaching people some sort of useful skill, it helps them look dumb in public.</p>

    <h2>The Basics</h2>

    <p>The general concept is that users progress through a set curriculum to add new dance moves to their repertoire.</p>

    <!--
    <p>The app has four main tabs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn — Progress through the dance tree to learn new moves.</li>
        <li>Moves — Explore and practice the moves that you've already learned.</li>
        <li>Store — Use the gold you've accumulated to purchase new moves and power-ups.</li>
        <li>Profile — Manage your account.</li>
    </ul>
    -->

    <p>The application revolves around <em>stances</em>. Stances are the foundation from which every dance move originates. For example, 'The Big Cheese' stance is characterized by the user standing with their knees bent, legs wide, and hands on their hips.</p>

    <div class="figure">

        <p class="caption">For the purposes of the conceptual design, I used the Baton Forms from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Smooth_Moves">WarioWare: Smooth Moves</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>Each resulting dance moves riffs on their initial stance, creating natural categorizations. Progressing through the curriculum unlocks more and more stances and moves.</p>

    <h2>Flow</h2>

    <p>The curriculum is presented to the user in stages. Each stage has the user learn a few moves across one or more stances. Moves are both presented as animations as well as step-by-step instructions.</p>

    <div class="figure mobile">
        <img src="/assets/images/dance/learn.gif"\>
        <p class="caption">Progress through new moves on the Learn tab.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Once the user has learned all moves and stances for a stage, they must complete a required <em>Skill Check</em> that has the user perform an assortment of moves from that stage. Once completed, a new stage of the curriculum is unlocked.</p>

    <div class="figure mobile">
        <img src="/assets/images/dance/skill-check.gif"\>
        <p class="caption">Complete a Skill Check<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1" title="Jump to footnote.">1</a></sup> to progress to the next stage.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Users can brush up on the dance moves they've learned at any time on moves tab. Users can flip through their deck of known stances to check out the associated moves.</p>

    <div class="figure mobile">
        <img src="/assets/images/dance/moves.gif"\>
        <p class="caption">The Moves tab is a quick way to see all known moves.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Users are rewarded with gold for completing skill checks and practicing moves. They can then spend that gold on new move sets and power ups in the store.</p>

        <p class="caption">Of course there's a store...</p>
