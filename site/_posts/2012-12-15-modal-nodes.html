		<p>Modal Nodes is a large-scale music sequencer which uses the Microsoft Kinect to gather all input. In the environment, users are able to place nodes on the screen to produce atmospheric musical sequences.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Concept</h3>
		<p>In Modal Nodes, user-created nodes act as musical notes which are placed around the virtual environment.  Their X position dictates when they are played, while their Y position determines their tone. Additionally, a node's Z position alters its diameter, which allows for fine-tuned timing.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Pose vs Gesture</h3>
		<p>A goal of this project was to test differences between gesture-based (movement over time) and pose-based (static) interactions. Through several user testing sessions, we found that gestures had good affordance yet caused higher levels of fatigue while poses were easily performed but had low discoverability. We decided to use a combination of both to optimize the experience.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Affordances</h3>
		<p>With walk-up-and-use being a necessity, we needed to make sure that the interactions were both intuitive and easy to perform. One way we accomplish this is by having the environment react as a user begins to complete an action.</p>

		<p>For example, when users begin the process of creating a node, the normally ambient particles move away from the background and swarm around a user’s hands – the closer a user is to completing the action, the tighter and faster the particles swarmed (as shown in an exaggerated form here).</p>

		<h3 class="title">Audio</h3>
		<p>We also placed a significant emphasis on ensuring that the resulting audio sequence is pleasant in every case. We got this by utilizing a fairly long echo effect which allows the tones to blend together nicely and by staying away from sharp, abrasive tones.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Setup</h3>
		<p>Modal Nodes was designed to be a public installation. Specifically, we wanted to create something that utilized a lot of space - like having the screen take up the entire side of a building while a group of up to 10 people interacted below. Unfortunately, spacial constraints limited our initial testing to about 4 users.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Improvements</h3>
		<p>Although pleased with our current implementation, we feel that our visualizations and interactions have not been fully realized. The interactions are not yet at a level in which the application could be used by a new user without some sort of instruction.  Furthermore, we seek to improve upon the audio processing capabilities of the system. Providing additional audio effects, either by having nodes interact with each other or through alteration of the nodes themselves, would provide further avenues for users to explore.</p>
