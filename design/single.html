				<h2>Overview</h2>

				<p>I worked with my friends Nancy and KeVon to develop an eMagazine based off of a sample article.  We worked through the entire life cycle of developing a consumer magazine and created a presentation pitching our final design which included a sample layout.</p>

				<p>The text we were given was a story titled “Bird Enemies”, written by John Burroughs in 1883. It is an essay describing the author’s experiences and thoughts on birds and we used it to help generate initial themes from which to base our magazine.</p>

	 			<h2>Direction</h2>
	 		</div>
	 		<div class="eight columns clearfix">
	 			<p>We knew from the beginning that we wanted to focus on minimal styling and liked the idea of juxtaposing that design principle with the subject of nature and wildlife. The text also brought about the theme of personal narratives – using first hand encounters could provide a more impactful storytelling experience.</p>
	 			<p>Additionally, we thought that personal stories would be a good way to reach an audience of outdoor lovers who had a hard time actually</p>

	 			<p>getting out and experiencing nature; or the armchair adventurer.</p>
	 			<p>Therefore, we set out to develop a modern take on the outdoor lifestyle magazine utilizing a sophisticated, restrained aesthetic.  It seeks to bring the experience of the outdoors into the reader’s home through the presentation of personal narratives of other outdoors enthusiasts.</p>

	 			<p>We began our research through competitive analysis. When doing so, we not only focused on target users and subject matter, but rated each competitor in regards to 5 main characterizations:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Minimal - The magazine uses a simple and clean visual style</li>
					<li>Tranquil - The magazine conveys a sense of calm and peacefulness</li>
					<li>Narrative - The magazine uses personal narrative to present information to the reader</li>
					<li>Visual - The magazine uses photographs and other visual elements to dictate the reading experience</li>
					<li>Local - The magazine features articles that are local to the reader’s location</li>
				</ul>
	 		</div>
	 		<div class="eight columns">
	 			<p>Our goal was to focus on the first three of those characteristics – minimal, tranquil, and narrative. We used our competitive analysis to see that there was a definite space in which our magazine could exist as well as determine a target age range for our audience. With this information in mind, we were able to develop several personas to cover a broad range of possible users and to ground ourselves when ideating.</p>
				
				<p>Furthermore, we developed a mood board to get a better sense of our design language. In it we found a great pairing of cool blues with soft greens and oranges and very clean, almost stark, imagery. From there, we began iterating through test layouts to determine our grid and information hierarchy.</p>

 			<div class="eight columns clearfix">
 				<p>In our final design, each article is presented as a single document which allows for continuous scrolling to the right.  In these articles, we create a fluid layout to draw a reader’s eye forward while remaining uncluttered and coherent.  This is done by allowing some elements to span gutters and also manipulating images to break out of their traditional frames.</p>
						
				<p>The design utilizes a subtle cartography theme throughout the magazine which was inspired by the outdoor subject matter; the title, NSEW, represents the cardinal directions and lines of latitude are used to represent article numbers within each issue.</p>
