		<h3 class="title">Research</h3>
		<p>To help identify common needs, we interviewed people that have extended experience with death and grievance from both personal and business perspectives. This included a funeral director and a grief counselor at the Carnegie Mellon Counseling and Psychological Services Office.  Additionally, we collected survey data from 150 subjects about dealing with loss and the inheritance of data-possessions (online profile data, images, and recording).</p>

		<h3 class="title">Refinement</h3>
		<p>Following an iterative process of ideation and refinement, we presented potential users with approximately 20 storyboard concepts. One concept, the idea of reincarnation through the transfer of DNA, elicited the most compelling participant responses. We felt the extreme strangeness of this concept paralleled the desperate irrationality of coping with death. And it seemed feasible enough that somebody might actually do it.</p>

		<p>We propose that, after the time of death, your loved oneâ€™s DNA is fused with that of a jellyfish to create an eternal, living memorial. There are some forms of Jellyfish that have shown the ability to essentially live forever by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/can-a-jellyfish-unlock-the-secret-of-immortality.html" target="_blank">cycling back and forth from adult to juvenile forms</a>. The result of this fusion is an intimate and eternally living memorial to accompany those who have suffered a loss.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Presentation</h3>
		<p>Given the delicate subject matter, we wanted to keep our concept video somewhat abstract to remove any specific personal attachments that people may feel - we felt that a less figurative style would be easiest for a universal audience to relate to. The main theme of the video is the timeline of a human life, which persists throughout the video both literally and figuratively.</p>

		<p>We saw that this concept received strong reactions when eliciting feedback from users, and led to unexpected conversations about cultural norms and beliefs. Our aim was to engage our audience in a personal state of reflection, and as a speculative design concept we believe it works well.</p>
