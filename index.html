                <p>As you may expect, NASA engineering data gets reviewed a lot, requiring the owner to merge and address comments from tons of documents.</p>
                <p>We sought to reduce this effort by developing a mechanism for having review discussions directly on the newly centralized, structured data being reviewed.</p>

                <h2>Improving digital signatures</h2>
                <p>Boy, NASA sure loves making people sign documents. Because of this, the need for functional digital signatures is real high.</p>
                <p>Our previous interface for digitally signing data needed improvements, so we re-designed the interactor to be easier to use and understand.</p>

                <p>Astronauts on the International Space Station follow pre-written procedures for pretty much everything. Those procedures, and the mechanism for viewing them, have many drawbacks.</p>
                <p>As a graduate research team, we built a head-mounted procedure viewer prototype to help maximize crew efficiency.</p>
