		<h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
		<p>Alititutor is a mobile application concept which seeks to make the lives of tutors easier. By streamlining the pains of scheduling, commuting, billing, and tracking student progress, a tutor can focus on what is truly important – their students.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Research</h3>
		<p>We started with researching what we called ‘mobile workers’ to see how they use their mobile devices while on the job. By conducting interviews with several of these users about their work habits and usage of mobile devices, we were able to gain a better understanding of the problems that needed to be solved. During this time, we saw tutors as an interesting problem space and decided to put our focus on how to improve their workflow. Specifically, we noticed that the way in which they manage their students and payments is a bulky and limiting process.

		After our user group was determined, we developed several personas in order to better understand who we were designing for. At the same time, we created a mood board to help identify our desired look and feel.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Prototypes</h3>
		<p>We had a couple of brainstorming sessions to figure out our possible feature set. As a group, we developed ideas on sticky notes and then created an affinity-like structure of design ideas. This helped to make sure we were all on the same page with what the application would support.

		We began ideating on the navigation and flow by having a few paper prototyping sessions – each team member spent time iterating on a prototype which would then be presented to the group and critiqued. We then took the elements we liked best from each prototype to form a coherent vision. Scheduling, commuting, tracking student progress, and billing were seen as the main pieces of functionality we wanted to focus on.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Iterations</h3>
		<p>With this application, we went through a couple of pivots. We initially wanted to keep the application very strict and directed – open the app, be presented with the information you need, get going. After all, this was meant to be for people who spend a lot of time in cars and it would be irresponsible to have to focus on a phone instead of the road.

		However, by going the direct route, the application was sparse and utilitarian. Based on feedback, we decided that it needed more of a creative edge and wanted to promote interaction between the student and the tutor.

		We had another brainstorming session to come up with new ideas like gamification elements and data visualizations. Unfortunately, this left us with a completely bloated and feature heavy application that wasn’t grounded in our actual research data.

		So, we toned it down again – getting rid of all the unnecessary junk that, while fun and exiting, didn’t really add any substance.

		I’m in the process of getting a copy of our video pitch.</p>
