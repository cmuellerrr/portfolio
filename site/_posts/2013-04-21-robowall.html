		<p>The Robowall is an interactive display on Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s campus. It was built to highlight projects, research, people, and events within the Human-Computer Interaction Institute and the Robotics Institute.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Concept</h3>
		<p>The wall was initially designed by a team of three of my classmates, Jason, Susan, and Kristine. I was then brought on to implement that design with Jason and two underclassmen, Kevin and Heidi.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Visuals</h3>
		<p>We sought to create a highly visual experience that would draw people in. We do this having the content react to movement. The wall also uses a tile-based layout which puts visual elements first. This has the added benefit of elegantly handling the variable content.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Curation</h3>
		<p>The wall was built with easy curation in mind; anyone with a CMU account may submit content for publication. Content then goes through an easy review process and can be sent back to the submitter with pre-defined feedback if it doesn't meet the institute's standards.</p>
