		<p>Flashtrack is an experiment in using computer vision as the sole means of accepting input to a game. The concept is to track an object held by the user and have them navigate an obstacle course by mapping the tracked object’s movement to that of the cursor.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Concept</h3>
		<p>Users are presented with a simple obstacle course – a start, a finish, and walls – and need to draw a single, continuous line from the start position to the end using their tracked object.  If a wall is touched, then the user has to start over. I wanted the users to be able to pick up the application without any need for instructions so there was a big focus on simple mechanics and clear goals.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Course Creation</h3>
		<p>Another aspect I wanted to tackle was user-created content.  Therefore, I developed a fairly robust creation utility.  Users can easily make or modify walls, delete points and the line segments between points, as well as save and load completed courses to XML files which were then used in the game.</p>
