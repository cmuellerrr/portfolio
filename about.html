    <section>
        <p>I'm currently an interaction designer at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/about/overview.html" target="_blank">NASA Ames Research Center</a> where I've most notably designed software for the Arc Jet facility (they do the heat shields) and the CoFR review process for future missions (think, "Go/No-go" meetings).</p>

        <p>Before that, I was a lead developer at DIRECTV working on internal software which, among other things, visualized signal flow and equipment status.</p>

        <p>I studied Computer Science at <a href="http://www.lmu.edu" target="_blank">Loyola Marymount University</a> and Human-Computer Interaction at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. Across both degrees I worked on projects involving location-based interaction, computer vision, public installations, and head-mounted displays.</p>

        <p>I enjoy making things and working with my hands. I like to rock climb and I try to spend time outdoors in places away from congestion.</p>

        <p>I do most of my work in Sketch and HTML/CSS/JS but my <a href="assets/resume.pdf" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> has a detailed breakdown of my skills and experience. Most of my projects are available on <a href="http://github.com/cmuellerrr/" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
