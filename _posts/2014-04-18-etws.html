    <p><b>NOTE: </b>Due to the nature of this work, I can't publish much detail of the process nor the final product. Therefore, I'll primarily be using wireframes to give a general idea of the concept.</p>

    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/thermophysics-facilities/arcjet-complex">NASA Ames Arc Jet Complex</a> tests vehicle heat shielding by simulating flight- and re-entry conditions (i.e. lights stuff on fire). They configure the equipment &mdash; and verify that configuration &mdash; for each test based on steps described in a <em>task worksheet</em>. Their old, paper-based process needed some improvements. We created a web-based tool for authoring worksheets and executing them on mobile devices.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The Arc Jet is a super complicated piece of equipment that can simulate flight- and re-entry conditions in a variety of different atmospheres. In order to configure this equipment properly for each test, test engineers create a <em>task worksheet</em> describing the equipment and configuration. The steps on this worksheet are executed by the facility technicians and verified by quality assurance.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The previous version of the worksheets were paper-based, which had the trade-offs you'd expect &mdash; it's portable and you can write on it, but it gets cluttered with revision markings, requires physical storage, it's not searchable, etc. So we were asked to look in to a way to get the best of both worlds while adding additional efficiencies resulting from our research.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
    <p>We started off by conducting interviews with several people who work with the <em>task worksheets</em> to model the flow from authoring to execution to actual testing. As part of this, we analyzed hundreds of existing worksheets to to determine what we called the worksheet's 'anatomy'. Basically it lays out the information being put in these worksheets (both planned and unplanned) and showed us the structure that we needed to design.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/etws/___.jpg"\>
        <p class="caption">The 'anatomy' looked something like this. Sort of a cross between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">CFG</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regex</a>.</p>

    <p>We also met with another group at Ames that used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf">COTS</a> mobile application for a similar type of problem. After exploring that option, we determined that it wasn't the right fit.</p>

    <h2>The final product</h2>
    <p>There are really two phases of the task worksheet life-cycle: authoring and execution. During our research, we saw that the worksheet authors did their test planning at their desktop computers, while executors were constantly on the move. So the system has authors use a web application to create worksheets using the building blocks we identified previously. When finished, that worksheet becomes available on a mobile device so executors can perform their work while moving around the complex. As they work, they can enter values and sign off on steps they've completed.</p>

    <p>During the design process, we had continual check-ins our stakeholders to make sure they were satisfied with the direction. Additionally, we set up usability tests with 6 people to verify it was easy to use.</p>

    <h2>Subsequent versions</h2>
    <p>Since the initial release in April 2014, we've had two major updates. Each release focused on adding a new capability to the system while making incremental improvements to existing features. They both used the standard methods of contextual inquiry, retrospective interviews, and usability testing.</p>
