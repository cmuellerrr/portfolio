    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>NASA organizations often store their authoritative data in Word documents and rely on built-in commenting features to facilitate their baseline reviews. As more and more orgs move to centralized, structured data systems, they need new tools to support those review processes. We designed a feature for users to have review discussions directly on the data they are reviewing.</p>

    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>Reviewing and discussing data is a common use case for NASA organizations. Typically, these organizations use emails, spreadsheets, or Word's commenting feature for their reviews. That approach has several issues:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reviewers work in a silo and frequently submit duplicate comments.</li>
        <li>The document author has to merge each reviewer's comments.</li>
        <li>Document authors need to track a document version for each review round.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="caption">Many organizations compile and disposition all comments in a separate spreadsheet. Image redacted.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A centralized data system, in itself, helps to resolve most the above issues, but our framework currently only allows users to comment on a record as a whole, which separates the discussion from its context.</p>

    <p><b>We sought to improve our commenting component by allowing users to comment directly on the data they are discussing.</b></p>

    <h2>Our solution</h2>

    <p>After several iterations and a competitive analysis of applications that provide commenting, we focused on a design that would be familiar to those accustomed to Word's commenting features<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1" title="Jump to footnote.">1</a></sup>. Discussions take place in the right-hand pane, and are toggled on and off with a button press.</p>

        <img class="border" src="/assets/images/comments/field-level.png"\>
        <p class="caption">Review discussions take place directly in context.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Our new design supports standard features like editing, deleting, and resolving. Additionally, our document analysis showed that most comment threads rarely go multiple levels deep, so we limited replies to a single level.</p>

        <p class="caption">Users can reply to high-level comments to start a thread.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>We usability tested the new design with 10 participants, moving through a real-life scenario that required the use of each feature.</p>

    <p>The tests resulted in the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Users easily formed a correct mental model of comment existence once identified.</li>
        <li>Commenting functions were quickly identifiable and behaved as users expected.</li>
        <li>Resolving comments required more steps than users expected.</li>
        <li>Users showed preference for hiding resolved comments, but wanted them viewable if needed.</li>
        <li>Color-coding comments according to user could add clarity to conversations, but more investigation needed.</li>
        <li>The expected meaning of the icon badge varied across users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The core commenting functions tested very well amongst our participants, with the majority of actionable feedback came from the handling of resolved comments. Contrary to our hypothesis, users were surprisingly cavalier in their desire to remove comments once resoled.</p>
