    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As you may expect, NASA engineering data gets reviewed a lot. Organizations often use Word and Excel documents to collect and disposition comments, which isn't something people look forward to. To reduce that pain, we made a mechanism for having review discussions directly on the centralized, structured data being reviewed.</p>

    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>Reviewing and discussing data is a common use case for NASA organizations. Typically, these organizations use emails, spreadsheets, or Word's commenting feature for their reviews. That approach has several issues:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reviewers work in a silo and frequently submit duplicate comments.</li>
        <li>The document author has to merge each reviewer's comments into a central location.</li>
        <li>Document authors need to track a document version for each review round.</li>
        <li>The discussion is separated from the data being discussed.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="caption">Many organizations compile and disposition all comments in a separate spreadsheet. Image redacted.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A centralized data system, in itself, helps to resolve a few of the above issues, but our framework only allows users to comment on a record as a whole, which still separates the discussion from its context.</p>

    <p><b>We sought to improve our commenting component by allowing users to comment directly on the data they are discussing.</b></p>

    <h2>Our process</h2>
    <p>Even though there were already several known issues, we wanted to better understand the way our users actually handle their commenting processes. To do this, we conducted several retrospective interviews where users would walk us through their process, making sure to collect the associated artifacts (and then some) for further analysis. Additionally, our competitive analysis gave us insight into how other applications are handling commenting.</p>

    <p>Our research pointed to a few key areas we wanted to focus on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Comments are more effective when tightly coupled with the data being discussed.</li>
        <li>Reviews are rarely one-sided and require ongoing discussion regarding a comment.</li>
        <li>Users consider comments a to-do list, and prefer to hide comments once they have been resolved.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall, we wanted to stick to a design that would be familiar to our users who typically use Word's commenting features<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1" title="Jump to footnote.">1</a></sup>, yet expanding on that functionality to address the issues found during our research.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Our solution</h2>
    <p>The data being reviewed in these processes is highly structured and, because it's important for comments to be closely coupled with the content being discussed, users may comment on each form field individually. However, comments aren't considered part of the <em>actual form data</em>, so our design aims to make that separation clear by moving the discussions to the right-hand gutter, outside of the form's borders.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img class="border" src="/assets/images/comments/field-level.png"\>
        <p class="caption">Review discussions take place directly in context.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We know that reviews are often a back-and-forth, so each comment may be replied to arbitrarily by any user in the system. Additionally, each field may have an arbitrary number of discussion threads going on at any given time.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/comments/threading.png"\>
        <p class="caption">Users can reply to high-level comments to start a thread.</p>
    </div>

    <p>After a discussion has taken place, the owner of the data needs to make changes where appropriate. To help keep track of which comments have already been addressed, users may mark comments as 'Resolved', hiding them from the comment list.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/comments/resolving.png"\>
        <p class="caption">Resolved comments can still be viewed and re-opened if necessary.</p>
    </div>
</section>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>We usability tested the new design with 10 participants, moving through a real-life scenario that required the use of each feature. The tests resulted in the following findings:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Users easily formed a correct mental model of comment existence once identified.</li>
        <li>Commenting functions were quickly identifiable and behaved as users expected.</li>
        <li>Resolving comments required more steps than users expected.</li>
        <li>Users showed preference for hiding resolved comments, but wanted them viewable if needed.</li>
        <li>Color-coding comments according to user could add clarity to conversations, but more investigation needed.</li>
        <li>The expected meaning of the icon badge varied across users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The core commenting functions tested very well amongst our participants, with the majority of feedback regarding the way resolved comments are handled. Contrary to our hypothesis, users were surprisingly cavalier in their desire to delete comments once addressed.</p>
