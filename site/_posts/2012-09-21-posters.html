		<h3 class="title">Product Re-design</h3>
		<p>I like peanut butter – and I buy my peanut butter from Costco – and those jars are huge.  They are larger than the knife I use to get the peanut butter out of the jar.  So, when the contents of the jar goes below 50% you end up getting your hand covered in peanut butter. Also, the jars have sharp contours at the top which collect peanut butter but they are inaccessible to your knife.</p>

		<p>So, in order to continue buying unnecessarily large jars of peanut butter, I set out to make the jar better.</p>

		<!--
		<p>I played with several iterations of the jar design – having the jar telescope to change sizes, putting a cap at both ends, and even using a Push Pop-like bottom to move the peanut butter to the top. Finally though, I decided that the best option would be to utilize a sectional structure in order to remove the unneeded portions of the jar when empty.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Avant-garde Architecture</h3>
		<p>This project was to design a poster for an architecture conference which would be viewed on a large LCD screen in a public area.  The text for the poster is related to a conference on the origins of avant-garde architecture in America which was held in New York.</p>

		<p>Inspired by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller, I took a modern, geometric approach. Also considering that the conference was located in New York and is about architecture, the Empire State Building seemed like a natural centerpiece for the poster.</p>
