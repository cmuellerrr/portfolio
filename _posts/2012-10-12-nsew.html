    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>We needed to design a magazine around a piece of writing from the 1800s. We created a concept combining modern, outdoor lifestyle with reader-submitted personal narratives. The design encorporates a cartography theme that is altered by the title region of each issue.</p>

	<h2>Inspiration from old writing</h2>
	<p>We were given a piece of writing and challenged to come up with a concept magazine inspired by its content. The supplied writing was the essay <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Pvlia3PHVakC&pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=bird+enemies+john+burroughs&source=bl&ots=_wZPG461WA&sig=JTHAmq8eEL1BHfjSi9xMT9YfEPk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0P7KVOGzOsSfyASp8YKYCg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=bird%20enemies%20john%20burroughs&f=false" target="_blank"><em>Bird Enemies</em></a>, written by John Burroughs in 1883. It's an account of the writer hiking through the woods and the wildlife (namely birds) around him.</p>

	<p>The theme of an outdoor lifestyle magazine jumped out pretty quick; the three of us all longed for adventure<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1" title="Jump to footnote.">1</a></sup> and thought it an interesting topic to build on. We also liked the idea of a magazine being fueled by personal narratives, like a journal. We thought that first-hand encounters would provide more impactful storytelling.</p>

	<p>We tried to identify a target audience and couldn't help but picture ourselves. Here's a group of graduate students longing to get outside but forced to live vicariously through other people because they basically couldn't leave their lab. This kind of thing also happens in big cities where it is difficult to leave the urban sprawl. A set of first-person accounts from the wilderness would be a great way to curb some of that wanderlust.</p>

	<p><b>We decided to make an outdoor lifestyle magazine fueled by reader-submitted personal narratives for people who couldn't get out and adventure for themselves.</b></p>

	<h2>Guidelines and the target reader</h2>
	<p>We set up five pillars that would act as our high-level design guidelines moving forward:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Minimal</b> – The magazine uses a simple and clean visual style</li>
		<li><b>Tranquil</b> – The magazine conveys a sense of calm and peacefulness</li>
		<li><b>Narrative</b> – The magazine uses personal narrative to present information to the reader</li>
		<li><b>Visual</b> – The magazine uses photographs and other visual elements to dictate the reading experience</li>
		<li><b>Local</b> – The magazine features articles that are local to the reader’s location</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We used those characterizations to compare our concept to a number of competitors to ensure that there was actually a void we were filling.</p>

		<p class="caption">Competitive analysis showed we could distinguish ourselves by focusing on narratives with a minimal, modern aesthetic.</p>
	</div>

	<p>We also developed personas to keep our design focused on our audience. One represented a young reader who is tech savvy but has a hard time actually getting outdoors. The other characterized someone with easier access to the wilderness but is looking for a way to share their experiences.</p>

	<h2>Finding an aesthetic</h2>
	<p>We build a mood board a better sense of our design language. We ended up with a soft pallet of grays, blues, and greens with fairly stark imagery. It seemed to mirror our pillars of minimalism and tranquility pretty well.</p>

	</div>

	<p>We ideated a bunch of concepts for the magazine's artistic direction, but tying it all together though a cartography motif really caught our eye. Then Nancy came up with a great logo using a point from a compass and it all made fell in to place. Each issue was to focus on stories from a particular area of the world. That issue would be titled based on that area's general degree of latitude and each story numbered as a derivative of the title degree.</p>

	<h2>Laying out a sample</h2>
	<p>The magazine is set up so readers scroll vertically between articles and each article is presented by continuous scrolling to the right. In these articles, we draw a reader’s eye continuously to the right by allowing some elements to span gutters and manipulating images to break out of their traditional frames. We called the magazine NSEW<sup><a id="ref2" href="#fn2" title="Jump to footnote.">2</a></sup> in reference to the 4 cardinal directions.</p>
