    <p>Boy oh boy, NASA sure loves making people sign documents. With continued movement away from paper-based processes, the need for functional digital signatures is increasing. Our previous interface for digital signatures needed improvements, so we re-designed the interactor to be easier to understand and use.</p>

    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>Digitally signing documents is the bread and butter of most NASA processes, so it is in everyone's best interest to make this work really well. Our framework provides this capability, but there are some obvious issues:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Current state relies on text only and is difficult to parse.</li>
        <li>The interactor obscures available actions a user may take.</li>
        <li>The signature layout does not follow the framework's grid (among other things).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>We sought to improve this component by making the current state easy to understand and clarifying the actions a user may take.</b></p>

    <h2>Our solution</h2>
    <p>After iterating on some ideas, we landed on a design that prioritized the current state of the signature by placing a small icon next to a description of that state. The icon is small, but provides just enough visual difference to quickly understand its meaning.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/signatures/new-states.png"\>
        <p class="caption">The new approach uses a simple stoplight metaphor<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1" title="Jump to footnote.">1</a></sup> to indicate status.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Nominally, a user may request, approve, reject, or reset a signature depending on their permissions. Our new design moved away from the dropdown interactor and instead exposed all of those available actions up front. Our hypothesis was that this would eliminate the need to open the dropdown to see what actions can be performed<sup><a id="ref2" href="#fn2" title="Jump to footnote.">2</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="caption">The new button group clarifies the action being taken.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>We usability tested the new design with 10 participants, focusing on the saliency of available actions. Additionally, we used a speed dating activity to test two design variants for indicating signature status.</p>

    <p>The tests resulted in the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>There was unanimous preference for visual indication of signature status.</li>
        <li>Exposing all possible actions up front reduced time to execution.</li>
        <li>Users were uncertain about the meaning of â€˜Unset' action.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The above findings showed that the new design was successful in meeting our goals to clarify the current state and available actions. We expected there to be issues with the 'Unset' action, but wanted evidence to change it before doing so.</p>
