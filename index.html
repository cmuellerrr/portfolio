                <p>I’m a UX designer based in San Francisco. I tackle all aspects of research and design, but I especially enjoy whitespace, consistency, and working fast.</p>
                <p>Check out some of my work below and feel free to <a href="mailto:chris@iammueler.com">get in touch</a>. Also, here's <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">my r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.</p>

                <p>You’ve likely seen lots of car commercials talking about winning J.D. Power awards for things like initial quality or dependability. The thing is, most consumers don’t even know what JDP does.</p>
                <p>J.D. Power wanted to change that (naturally), and we worked together to design their first consumer-oriented website focused on car-buying research.</p>

                <p>Vlocity is one of Salesforce's fastest growing partners, and they offer (among other things) white-label software across all kinds of industries.</p>
                <p>They wanted to re-design their telecomm mobile app to add some 'wow' factor, so we took an animation-heavy approach to give them something that really got people's attention.</p>

                <p>As you may expect, NASA engineering data gets reviewed...a lot, requiring the owner to merge and address comments from tons of documents.</p>
                <p>We sought to improve this process by centralizing the data being reviewed and designing tools allowing review discussions to take place alongside the data itself.</p>

                <p>The Ames Arc Jet Complex tests spacecraft heat shielding by simulating flight- and re-entry conditions. As you can imagine, this is a complex process requiring total accuracy.</p>
                <p>Working with the Arc Jet team, we created a responsive web application to improve their test setup process by reducing errors and increasing worksheet completion.</p>

                <p>Astronauts on the International Space Station follow pre-written procedures for pretty much everything. Those procedures, and the mechanisms for viewing them, leave much to be desired.</p>
                <p>As a graduate research team, we sought to improve these proceedures by building a head-mounted procedure viewer.</p>
