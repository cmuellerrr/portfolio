		<p>JavaScriptIOn is an attempt to allow direct I/O from the Firefox web browser using only native JavaScript – no plugins. The goal was to allow developers to handle complex I/O like webcam input using simple JavaScript objects without having to force users to download a Flash plugin.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Proof of Concept</h3>
		<p>I developed a proof of concept of this by creating a native JavaScript object representing a PlayStation3 Dualshock 3 controller.  In order to do this I had to first create a simple Linux driver for the controller which could read what buttons were pressed (and how hard).  That driver was then hooked up to the C implementation of the JavaScript object to pass the data up to the web browser.  In the end, the browser was able to see all input from the controller using that single object.</p>

		<p>Admittedly, the project didn’t get as far as I had hoped, but it was very close.  Ideally, this concept could have been abstracted further to allow for easy extension in addition to a more useful proof of concept like being able to navigate a web page using the controller.</p>
