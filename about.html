    <h1>More things about me</h1>
    <p>I'm currently an interaction designer at NASA Ames Research Center where I've worked on things like a mobile task worksheet for the Arc Jet facility and a system for maintaining the flight readiness process for future exploration missions. Before that I was a lead developer at DIRECTV working on internal software that, among other thigns, visualized signal flow and equipment status.</p>
    <p>I studied <em>Computer Science</em> at Loyola Marymount University and <em>Human-Computer Interaction</em> at Carnegie Mellon University. Across both degrees I worked on projects involving location-based interaction, computer vision, public installations, and head-mounted displays.</p>
    <p>I like to rock climb and I try to spend time outdoors in places away from congestion.</p>
    <p>I do most of my work in Sketch and HTML/CSS/JS but my <a href="assets/resume.pdf" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> has a more detailed breakdown of my skills and experience.</p>
