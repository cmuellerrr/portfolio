		<p>The Robowall is an interactive display to be installed on Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s campus in Newell-Simon Hall. The wall is a series of three 46 inch touch panel displays which highlight projects, research, people, and events that pertain to the Human-Computer Interaction Institute and the Robotics Institute.</p>

		<p>The wall was initially designed by a team of three of my classmates, Jason, Susan, and Kristine.  I was then brought on to implement that design with Jason and two underclassmen, Kevin and Heidi.</p>

		<p>Of course, the design still needed some refinement and the entire content management and generation framework had to be created, so we spent significant time iterating that design and working with stakeholders in both institutes to make sure we were meeting their needs.

		For the wall itself, we want to create a highly visual experience that would draw people in and make them diverge from their intended path. We do this by using the Microsoft Kinect to track movement and have the content react to it.

		The wall is still in progress, but is scheduled for installation this Summer.</p>
