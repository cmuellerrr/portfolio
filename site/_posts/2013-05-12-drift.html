		<h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
		<p>We were tasked with creating a ubiquitous computing solution for a design space grounded in spirituality. We wanted to look at subject matter which was thought provoking and isn’t something that is typically designed for. We chose to design in the funeral space for users who are dealing with the grief of losing a loved one.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Research</h3>
		<p>We interviewed people that have extended experience with death and grievers from both the personal and business points of view. We spoke with a funeral director at McCabe Bros. Funeral Home and we spoke with a grief counselor at the Carnegie Mellon Counseling and Psychological Services Office.

		We also collected survey data from 150 subjects about the general topic of dealing with loss. Our questions focused on coping with the loss and dealing with the inheritance of the deceased’s data-possessions (online profile data, images, recordings). We thought it was important to ask broad questions to keep the survey-takers comfortable and to uncover needs that may be unexpected.

		Our synthesis process consisted of building an affinity diagram with information we recorded in interviews. We grouped the data to uncover common themes and patterns in the data we collected.

		We drew overarching themes from our synthesis of the data we collected and used them to drive our design ideation process. Overall we came up with roughly 50 ideas. Some of our ideas were grounded in feasibility while others were less concrete, drawing on future visioning concepts.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Storyboards</h3>
		<p>During our ideation session, we thought of ways we can meet the needs we uncovered in our synthesis process. We generated several storyboards illustrating possible implementations of systems and products that could meet those needs. We had ideas like sunglasses which contextually darkened to hide tears, a giant installation which reacted to global death tolls to guide perspective, and pins that would allow funeral attendees to share memories based on proximity to others.

		We used the storyboards we developed to rapidly test out our concepts with potential users, in the 25 – 30 year old age range, specifically those that had experience dealing with a loss. We used the feedback from the storyboard “speed dating” to decide on a specific concept: DNA reincarnation.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Concept</h3>
		<p>Yeah, DNA Reincarnation. The idea is that, after the time of death, your DNA is fused with that of a jellyfish and given to loved ones to create a living memorial. We chose jellyfish because there are some forms which have shown the ability to essentially live forever by cycling back and forth from adult to juvenile forms (cite).

		This concept was easily the most out-there one we had, but we all thought it was the most interesting and wanted to see if we could pull it off. Also, when would we get the chance to work on a project like this again?</p>

		<h3 class="title">Video</h3>
		<p>We developed a video sketch to present our project. Because of the subject matter, we put several constraints on how we would present this material.

		Abstract – because it is such a sensitive subject, we wanted to keep the video abstract to remove any attachment people may feel.
		Scientific – our idea is kind of out there – we know – so we wanted to approach it from a scientific angle to try and reduce disbelief.
		Black & White – the previous two constraints kind of led us to this one. I is a more appropriate aesthetic.
		We created the video in After Effects. The main theme of the video is the timeline of a human life, which we follow throughout the video. We switch the background color several times to try and give a sense of distinct scenes so we had to pay a lot of attention to transitions between them. So, we played with scale and animations to get from one scene to another.

		There are still some improvements to be made: animations to tighten up, some improved visuals, and a better voiceover (although KeVon still did a good job).</p>
