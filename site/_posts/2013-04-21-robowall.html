<div class="section">
	<h3 class="title">Concept</h3>
	<p>The wall was initially designed by a team of three of my classmates, Jason, Susan, and Kristine. I was then brought on to implement that design with Jason, Kevin, and Heidi.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Visuals</h3>
	<img class="fill" src="/assets/images/robowall/concept_ui.png">
	<p>We sought to create a highly visual experience that would draw people in. We do this having the content react to movement. The wall also uses a tile-based layout which puts visual elements first. This has the added benefit of elegantly handling the variable content.</p>

<div class="section">
	<h3 class="title">Curation</h3>
	<p>The wall was built with easy curation in mind; anyone with a CMU account may submit content for publication. Content then goes through an easy review process and can be sent back to the submitter with pre-defined feedback if it doesn't meet the institute's standards.</p>
