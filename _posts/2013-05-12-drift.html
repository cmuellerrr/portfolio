    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>We created a concept that attempts to aid the grieving process. After speed dating concepts, one involving reincarnation got the most compelling reactions. We chose to run with that one. It resulted in a concept challenging the cultural mechanisms people use to memorialize those who have passed away.</p>

    <h2>The design space</h2>
    <p>We were given a prompt to develop a concept for a ubiquitous computing solution which was rooted in the religious/spiritual space<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1" title="Jump to footnote.">1</a></sup>. After some initial brainstorming, we decided to focus on the topic of death and grieving because it is an uncomfortable design space, is highly spiritual regardless of religion, and a socially ubiquitous topic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Planning our research</h2>
    <p>We determined who we should speak with by laying out a simple spectrum of who is involved when someone dies. To one extreme are those focused on logistics and business, on the other were those focused on personal healing. The ones in need sit in the middle.</p>

        <p class="caption">We identified stakeholders to speak with in each category along our spectrum.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In our research, we wanted to gain insight into all aspects of death, such as the logistics of the burial process, cultural differences in ceremonies, and dealing with the deceased's online presence<sup><a id="ref2" href="#fn2" title="Jump to footnote.">2</a></sup>.</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>[Images on social media] were helpful and painful but they allowed me to remember how important this person was and how much happiness they brought. It encouraged me to try and continue to bring some of that goodness to the world.</p>

    <h2>Extracting insights</h2>
    <p>We were able to interview a local funeral director as well as a grief counselor at the Carnegie Mellon Counseling and Psychological Services Office. Additionally, we collected survey data from 150 participants about dealing with the loss of loved ones.</p>

        <p class="caption">We got a lot of really great responses from our survey participants.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This project included one of the more interesting synthesis sessions I've been a part of. It's a very personal subject but I was surprised at how open others were in talking about their experience. We came away with five main insights:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Grief comes in waves.</li>
        <li>Grief is painful but needs to be felt.</li>
        <li>The death of a loved one is inconvenient.</li>
        <li>Physical objects carry great association to the deceased.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, a conversation with the one who passed needs to continue after death.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting strong reactions</h2>
    <p>We didn't hold back in our concepts; some were conservative and grounded in reality and some were way out of the box. We generated about 20 unique storyboard concepts that we ran through several speed dating sessions. Three particular concepts elicited the strongest reactions. Those concepts focused on the themes of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Separating the meaning and emotion behind an object from the object itself.</li>
        <li>A way to share memories about the deceased at a funeral in a way that feels natural.</li>
        <li>The memorialization of the deceased.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/drift/death_machine.png"\>
        <p class="caption">One concept sought to make the subject more prevalent via a large sculpture that changed appearance based on the rate and cause of death across the globe.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Strong reactions, both positive and negative, are what you are looking for when speed dating. One of those three concepts elicited, by far, the most compelling reactions. That concept dealt with the idea of creating a living memorial through the transfer of the decease's DNA into another organism.</p>

    <h2>Wait, what?</h2>
    <p>Yeah, I know. But this is just a speculative concept that is meant to elicit discussion, so bear with me<sup><a id="ref3" href="#fn3" title="Jump to footnote.">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>A lot of people memorialize loved ones with physical objects. But those are just static <em>objects</em>. What if the memorial was an actual living being, like a pet<sup><a id="ref4" href="#fn4" title="Jump to footnote.">4</a></sup>? One of the problems with that is then having to go through more grieving when the pet eventually passes away. However, there are some forms of jellyfish that have shown the ability to essentially live forever by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/can-a-jellyfish-unlock-the-secret-of-immortality.html">cycling back and forth from adult to juvenile forms</a>. We saw that as an interesting opportunity.</p>

    <p>Our concept proposes that, after the time of death, your loved oneâ€™s DNA is fused with that of a jellyfish to create an eternal, living memorial. The result of this fusion is an intimate and living remembrance to accompany those who have suffered a loss.</p>

        <p class="caption">The assignment deliverable was supposed to be a video storyboard, but we thought an animation would be way better. Totally worth not sleeping.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We made a video to introduce our concept. The video uses a subdued and scientific approach because the concept itself is so wild. People's reactions were great; there was a long conversation about cultural mechanisms of memorialization and some even said they found it beautiful. I'll take it.</p>
