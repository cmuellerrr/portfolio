            <p><a href="https://www.vlocity.com">Vlocity</a> is one of Salesforce's fastest growing partners, providing software improvements for variety of industries like healthcare and finance. One of their offerings is a mobile app that telecom companies use as a starting point from which to build their own, branded app.</p>

            <p>With Dreamforce coming up, Vlocity wanted to refresh the app's design to add some 'wow' factor and asked us to take a crack at it. Naturally, we jumped at the opportunity to design what would end up as a showpiece for their booth at Dreamforce 2018.</p>

        <h2>Our solution</h2>
        <p>Vlocity really wanted a design that was unique and eye catching, so we knew that a standard layout wasn't going to cut it. We focused the whole experience around a fluid, scrolling pattern to navigate from a plan overview to detailed device statistics. This gave us a great signature interaction that felt really natural in your hand.</p>

        <h2>Our solution</h2>
        <p>Smart assistants have been all the rage recently, but they often feel shallow and tacked on. We tried to make this feature more useful by providing contextual suggestions throughout the experience. When 'chatting' with the assistant, our goal was for the user to never use the keyboard by always surfacing the most likely actions and responses.</p>

        <h2>Our solution</h2>
        <p>E-commerce is a big part of the telecom industry and we wanted that portion of the app to exhibit the same fluidity as the main page. By animating common elements from page to page, the store felt like one seamless experience as opposed to a set of distinct screens.</p>
