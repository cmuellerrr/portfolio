	<h3 class="title">Research</h3>
	<p>We conducted interviews with several 'mobile workers' about their work habits and usage of mobile devices while on the job. During this time, we saw tutors as an interesting problem space. Specifically, we noticed that the way in which they manage their students and payments is a bulky and limiting process.</p>

	<p>After our user group was determined, we developed several personas and a mood board in order to better understand potential users and identify our desired look and feel.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Prototypes</h3>
	<p>When brainstorming, we put all ideas on sticky notes and then created an affinity-like structure of design ideas. We then developed paper prototypes to get a better sense of the application's flow. A coherent vision was decided by piecing together the best elements from each prototype. Scheduling, commuting, student progress, and billing were identified as the major features to support.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Design</h3>
	<p>The application is designed to be utilitarian – open the app, be presented with the information you need, get going. Users have a schedule of appointments, a roster for tracking student progress and payments, and an overview to track weekly/monthly earnings and productivity.</p>
