        <p>I like working with my hands. I'm also sick of crappy Ikea furniture. It seemed pretty natural to combine those two things, so I started designing and building my own furniture. It's primarily woodworking, but I've done a bit of welding on some projects. Here are a few of the things I've made.</p>
