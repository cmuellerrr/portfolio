		<h3 class="title">Peanut Butter Revolution</h3>
		<p>I like peanut butter – and I buy my peanut butter from Costco – and those jars are huge.  They are larger than the knife I use to get the peanut butter out of the jar.  So, when the contents of the jar goes below 50% you end up getting your hand covered in peanut butter.

		Also, the jars have sharp contours at the top which collect peanut butter but they are inaccessible to your knife.  In order to continue buying unnecessarily large jars of peanut butter, I set out to make the jar better.

		The first thing I sought to do was to reduce the amount of plastic used for the bottles by making the lid thinner.  This would do two things: reduce waste and compensate for any added plastic of the final design.  I then decided to make the edges completely smooth so that all peanut butter would be in reach while also giving the entire jar a sleeker look and feel.

		I played with several iterations of the jar design – having the jar telescope to change sizes, putting a cap at both ends, and even using a Push Pop-like bottom to move the peanut butter to the top. Finally though, I decided that the best option would be to utilize a sectional structure in order to remove the unneeded portions of the jar when empty.

		In terms of the poster, I decided to go with a constructivist, propaganda design.  I figured that I needed powerful imagery in order to give this important subject matter the attention it deserves.  Plus, I figured it would be fun to try designing something with such a distinct style.

		So, I went in to researching the period and some authentic Soviet propaganda posters and, as expected, saw a heavy use of red, strong calls to action, fists, distressing, and the rising sun type of radial background.

		My first iteration tried to use as little text as possible and focus on the jar itself but this seemed somewhat bland; I wanted a greater feeling that this was a cause that needed to be fought for.

		I pivoted to focus on a group of rising fists and included more detailed description of how this jar helps you overcome the injustices of the peanut butter world. Also, I chose a color pallet that better emphasized the golden, peanut buttery goodness that inspired the product redesign itself.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Avant Garde Architecture</h3>
		<p>This project was to design a poster for an architecture conference which would be viewed on a large LCD screen in a public area.  The text for the poster is related to a conference on the origins of avant garde architecture in America which was held in New York.

		To get a better sense of the conference’s subject matter, I began researching some of America’s more famous architectural structures which were considered avant garde for their time.

		So, I did some digging on Frank Lloyd Wright, Buckminster Fuller, and Frank Gehry (even though he’s Canadian). I find Fuller’s geometric work to be really inspiring and I thought it could be an interesting direction to take the design.

		I tend to lean towards what is considered modern styling and this seemed like the perfect subject matter in which to practice using that aesthetic.  Therefore, with the focus on making a modern piece, I wanted to refrain from cluttering the space with unnecessary images and effects.

		Also considering that the conference was located in New York and is about architecture, the Empire State Building seemed like a natural centerpiece for the poster.  I made some initial designs that included a silhouette of the building to add depth and scale to the poster.

		However, there needed to be more to catch the public’s eye. I decided to look at what was considered avant garde in the art world during the periods of these architects to find parallels in aesthetic value. That research led me to a typeface designed by Dylan Mulvaney for Manhattan Magazine. Using this as inspiration, I came up with the layered polygon mask for the Empire State Building which I feel adds the right amount of color and vibrancy.

		I used tactics such as justification of the text, a light radial gradient to draw focus to the middle of the poster and light blue headers to bring the eye to the important information</p>
